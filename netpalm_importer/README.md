# 🌴 Netpalm -> Netbox Importer

Quick and dirty node script with a lot hardcoded still at the moment.

However, it works to grab interfaces off your devices and spits out a csv ready to import into netbox.

### 🚀 Getting Started

1. Customize your netpalm `netmiko_retrieve_data` service call arguments.
2. Run `npm run retrieve`
3. Copy the resulting `taskId`
4. Run `npm run task -- [taskId]` replace `[taskId]` with the ID you just copied
5. While its still running it will return "Running", however once its completed it will return **"Interfaces dumped!"**

You will then have an interfaces.csv file in your project root with the results based upon the format in the `getTask` function

You can copy the contents of this into the import field on your Netbox instance at https://netbox.company.com/dcim/interfaces/import/

### 🚧 To Do

- Definitely need to make much more of this dynamic.
  - i.e. Ability to define API Key, Username, Password, etc. in `.env` file for example
  - Define output format
  - Define output fields which will be the same for all interfaces, i.e. `device`
